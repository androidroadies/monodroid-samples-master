Facebook Binding
================

This sample demonstrates Android Library Project support, as extension to
Java Binding library project.

Facebook Android library is available at github:
https://github.com/facebook/facebook-android-sdk

This sample contains the prebuilt library project as a zip,
which is then referenced by Mono.Facebook.csproj.

There is a "simple" example which is ported from facebook SDK sample.
